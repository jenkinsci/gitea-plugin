        Overrides the defaults for webhook management.

        Webhooks are used to inform Jenkins about changes to repositories. There are two ways webhooks can be
        configured:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manual webhook configuration requires the user to configure Gitea with the Jenkins URL in order
            to ensure that Bitbucket will send the events to Jenkins after every change.
        </li>
        <li>Automatic webhook configuration requires that Jenkins has credentials with sufficient permission to
            configure webhooks and also that Jenkins knows the URL that Gitea can connect to.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <strong>Manage Jenkins » Configure System › Gitea Server</strong> allows defining the list of
        servers. Each server can be associated with credentials. If credentials are defined then the default behaviour
        is to use those credentials to automatically manage the webhooks of all repositories that Jenkins is interested
        in. If no  credentials are defined then the default behaviour is to require the user to manually configure
        webhooks.
